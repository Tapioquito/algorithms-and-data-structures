- It's similar do bubble sort, but instead of first placing the large values into sorted postion,
 it places small values into sorted position one at a time

                PSEUDO CODE

- Store the FIRST element as the SMALLEST value you've seen so far;
- COMPARE this item to the next item in the array until you find a SMALLER number;
- Then UPDATE the variable with the new minimum;
- Do NOT save the value itself, but the INDEX of where that value is found
- Continue until the end of the array
- If the "minimum" is not the value (index) you initially began with, SAWP the two values
- Repeat this proccess with the next element until the array is sorted.

                "BIG O" NOTATION

- Time complexity of O(nÂ²)
- Generally bubble sort is better
- That said, were we worried about writing on memory, selection sort would be better
