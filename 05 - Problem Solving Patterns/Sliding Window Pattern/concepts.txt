Sliding Window Patterns involves creating a WINDOW wich can either be an array or number from one position to another;

Depending on a certain condition, the window either INCREASES or CLOSES  (and a NEW window is created);

Very useful for KEEPING TRACK of a subset of data in an array/string/etc.

Write a function called maxSubArraySum which accepts an array of integers AND a number called "n";

The function should calculate the maximum sum of "n" consecutive elements in the array;
