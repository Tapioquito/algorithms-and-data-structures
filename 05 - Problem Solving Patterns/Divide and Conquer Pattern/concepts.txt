#########################  DIVIDE AND CONQUER #########################

1 - This pattern involves dividing a data  set into smaller chunks and then 
REPEATING a process with a subset of data.

2 - This pattern can tremendously DECREASE time complexity.

Example: Given a SORTED array of integers, write a function called binarySearch 
that accepts a value and returns the INDEX where the value passed to the function is located.
If the value is not found, return -1.
