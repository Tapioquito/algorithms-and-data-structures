            INSERTION SORT

- It's similar to bubble and selectio sort;
- Nevertheless, it has some advantages;
- It builds up the sort by gradually creating a larger left half wich is ALWAYS sorted;

            PSEUDOCODE
- Start by picking the SECOND element in the array
- Now compare the second element with the one BEFORE it and SWAP if necessary
- Continue to the next element and if it is in the correct order, 
iterate through the sorted portion to place the element in the correct place.
