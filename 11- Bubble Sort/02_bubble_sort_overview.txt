                        BUBBLE SORT

    
    1) It's a sorting algorithm where the LARGEST VALUES
    bubble up to the top!

    2) Before we sort, we must SWAP!
        - Many sorting algorithms involve some swapping functionality (e.g. swapping
        numbers to put them in order) 
    
    ES5:
    function swap(arr, idx1, idx2){
        let temp = arr[idx1];
        arr[idx1] = ar[idx2];
        arr[idx2] = temp;
    }

    ES2015:
    const swap = (arr, idx1, idx2) => {
        [arr[idx1], arr[idx2]] = [arr[idx2], arr[idx1]]
    }

    3) Bubble Sort PSEUDOCODE:
        - Start looping from with a variable called "i" 
        at the END of the array towards the BEGINNING;
        - Start an inner loop with a variable called j from the BEGINNING
        until -1;
        - If arr[j] is GREATER than arr[j+1], SWAP those two values!;
        - Return the sorted array;

    4) BIG O Complexity:
        - In general, is O(nÂ²)
        - If it's halfway sorted, it's linear time O(n)
        - Bubble sort is not the best algorithm, but it's a good starting point for learning!
